"""Data access for exchange transfer history (deposits and withdrawals).

Two tables. ``transfer_history`` is the record of individual transfers, keyed
for idempotency on ``(user, connection, kind, dedupe_key)``. ``transfer_sync_state``
is the resume state for the chunked backfill, one row per (connection, kind).

The one invariant worth stating up front: ``synced_through`` advances **only**
inside :meth:`save_window`, in the same transaction as the rows that window
covered. A failed commit therefore leaves the watermark where it was and the
window is re-read next time — which is why that method takes a raw connection
rather than a series of ``execute_non_query`` calls that would each commit
separately.
