# Cyrus

A Windows desktop app for automating and monitoring cryptocurrency trading across multiple exchanges. Electron + TypeScript frontend, local Python Flask backend, SQLite storage. Your API keys never leave your machine.

Cyrus is free for noncommercial use. If it saves you time, [sponsoring it on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/JonathanEDressel) keeps development going.

## Supported Exchanges

Cyrus talks to exchanges through [CCXT](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt). Capabilities differ per exchange, and that determines which automations are available.

| Feature | Kraken | Coinbase Advanced | Binance | Robinhood |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| View open orders | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 🧪 |
| View account balances | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 🧪 |
| Portfolio valuation & charts | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 🧪 |

| Action: Convert crypto | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 🧪 |
| Action: Withdraw to address | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Whitelisted withdrawal addresses | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

✅ supported · ❌ not available · 🧪 experimental

> **Withdrawals are Kraken-only.** Coinbase Advanced and Binance don't expose a withdrawal address book or crypto withdrawal endpoint through CCXT, so any withdraw-based rule is unavailable there. Convert actions work everywhere.
>
> **Coinbase Advanced (Beta)** — served through CCXT's `coinbase` class (the Advanced Trade API). Connect with keys from Coinbase Advanced, not the standard app.
>
> **Binance (Beta)** — no withdrawal whitelist API via CCXT.
>
> **Robinhood (Experimental)** — uses a direct API adapter rather than CCXT and is still in progress. Treat it as unfinished.

Capability flags live in `src/backend/helper/ExchangeRegistry.py` and are enforced in code — the automation wizard flags unsupported combinations as you build a rule, and the backend rejects them on save regardless.

## Features

**Automation**
- Three trigger types — an order fills, a balance crosses a threshold, or a price hits a target
- Two actions — convert one asset into another, or withdraw to a whitelisted address
- Per-rule cooldowns and optional execution limits (auto-pauses when reached)
- Three-step creation wizard with starter templates and a plain-English summary before you commit
- Execution log recording every outcome: success, error, or skipped — with the reason
- Flow chart view showing where your automations move funds

**Monitoring**
- Portfolio overview with value history charts
- Open orders across every connected exchange
- Resting limit orders in one table — click a row for full detail, or select several and cancel them together
- Transfer history (deposits and withdrawals) backfilled from each exchange and cached locally
- A date-ordered roadmap of where funds actually moved — transfers between two connected exchanges are paired automatically by shared transaction hash, or by amount and timing allowing for network fees
- Label your own wallet addresses so one-sided transfers get attributed too; an unlabelled counterparty is reported as unknown rather than guessed at
- Bulk-import wallets from a downloadable Excel template (or CSV), with a preview of exactly what will be added before anything is written
- Watchlist with price data
- Optional monthly email report
- Desktop notifications and optional email alerts when a rule executes

**Reliability**
- Live engine heartbeat on the Automations page — shows when rules were last checked, so a stalled worker can't hide
- Runs in the system tray; closing the window keeps automations going
- Optional start-at-login
- Rotating log file at `%APPDATA%\Cyrus\logs\cyrus.log`

**Security**
- Exchange API keys Fernet-encrypted at rest
- Backend binds to loopback only; nothing is sent to a third-party server
- Light and dark themes

---

## How automations work

A rule is a **trigger** plus an **action**, scoped to one exchange connection.

A background worker thread inside the backend wakes every 60 seconds and, for each active rule, checks whether the trigger is satisfied. If it is, the rule is marked as triggered *before* the action runs (so a slow exchange call can't cause a double-fire), the action executes, and the outcome is written to the execution log.

Rules only run while Cyrus is running. Closing the window keeps it alive in the tray; quitting from the tray stops everything. The heartbeat indicator on the Automations page tells you which state you're actually in — if it says anything other than *Automations running*, nothing is being evaluated.

Every non-execution is logged too — below threshold, below the exchange's minimum withdrawal, cooling down — so "nothing happened" always has a visible reason.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend** — Electron, TypeScript, vanilla JS/HTML/CSS (no framework, no bundler)
**Backend** — Python 3.11+, Flask, SQLite, CCXT

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18+ — [download](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Python** 3.11+ — [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Git** — [download](https://git-scm.com/)

SQLite ships with Python; there's no separate database to install.

---

## Install (end users)

1. Click **Releases** on the right of this page
2. Download `Cyrus.Setup.X.X.X.exe`
3. Run it and follow the installer

---

## Install (from source)

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Cyrus
```

### 2. Backend

```bash
cd src/backend

# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install pyinstaller     # needed later to build the installer
```

> Install PyInstaller **inside the Cyrus venv**, not globally — otherwise it won't resolve `ccxt` and friends when you build.

Start it:

```bash
python Server.py
```

You should see:

```
[DATABASE] Tables created/verified successfully
CYRUS_PORT=5000
```

That `CYRUS_PORT=` line is not cosmetic — Electron parses it from stdout to find the backend. Don't change its format.

### 3. Frontend

In a **second terminal**, from the repo root:

```bash
npm install
npm run build      # or: npm run watch
```

---

## Running in development

Development needs **two terminals**. `npm start` does *not* start the backend — in dev, Electron assumes you launched it yourself on port 5000.

**Terminal 1 — backend**
```bash
cd src/backend
venv\Scripts\activate      # macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
python Server.py
```

**Terminal 2 — frontend**
```bash
npm start                  # or: npm run dev
```

### Environment variables

Optional `.env` in the repo root:

```env
SECRET_KEY=change-this-to-a-random-secret-key-min-32-chars
API_PORT=5000

# Optional. Defaults to src/backend/kraking.db in dev,
# %APPDATA%\Cyrus\kraking.db when packaged.
DATABASE_PATH=kraking.db

# Optional. Seconds between automation checks (default 60, clamped 10-3600).
CYRUS_POLL_INTERVAL=60
```

`CYRUS_PARENT_PID` is set automatically by Electron — the backend watches that process and exits when it does, so a crashed app can't leave an orphaned server holding port 5000.

> **Changing `SECRET_KEY` invalidates every stored exchange key and every issued token.** The encryption key is derived from it. Set it once, then leave it alone.

### Notes for contributors

- **There is no test suite and no linter.** To sanity-check backend edits: `venv\Scripts\python.exe -m py_compile <files...>`. For the frontend, `npm run build` succeeding is the bar.
- **The frontend has no module system at runtime.** TypeScript compiles per-file, but files load as plain `<script>` tags, so everything is global. Do **not** add `import`/`export` to anything under `src/app/`.
- **New services/controllers need a `<script>` tag** in `src/index.html`, placed after their dependencies. Forgetting this is the most common "why is my new code undefined" bug. Viewmodels are the exception — the router loads those.
- **Schema changes** go in `helper/MigrateDatabase.py` as idempotent migrations, not `SetupDatabase.py`, so existing installs upgrade cleanly.
- Flask debug mode is **not** enabled and there is no auto-reload. Restart the backend after Python changes.

---

## First-time usage

1. **Create an account** — click *Create Account*, pick a username (3+ chars) and password (6+ chars)
2. **Connect an exchange** — *Profile → Exchange Connections*, add your API key and secret, then *Test* to validate
3. **Look around** — *Overview* for portfolio, *Open Orders* for live orders, *Transfers* for deposit and withdrawal history
4. **Create an automation** — *Automations → New Automation*, pick a trigger and action, review, save
5. **Check the heartbeat** — the pill at the top of the Automations page should read *Automations running*

### API key permissions

Grant the minimum your rules need. Convert actions need trade permission; withdraw actions additionally need withdraw permission **and** the destination address must already be whitelisted on the exchange. Cyrus cannot add addresses to a whitelist — it can only send to entries that already exist.

**Transfer history needs a permission trading does not.** A key created for trading can read balances and place orders but still be refused funding history, because that sits behind a separate scope — *Query Funds* on Kraken, *Enable Reading* on Binance, transaction access on a Coinbase CDP key. Cyrus validates keys against a balance call, so this only surfaces the first time you open the Transfers page; when it does, the page names the missing permission and stops retrying until you re-validate. Robinhood exposes no transfer-history API at all.

## Building the Windows installer

```bash
# 1. Compile TypeScript
npm run build

# 2. Build the backend executable (from the Cyrus venv)
cd src/backend
venv\Scripts\activate
pyinstaller server.spec
deactivate
cd ../..

# 3. Bump the version
npm version X.X.X

# 4. Build the installer -> release/Cyrus Setup X.X.X.exe
npm run dist

# 5. Publish
gh release create vX.X.X "release/Cyrus Setup X.X.X.exe" --title "vX.X.X" --notes "Your notes"
```

Step 2 must run before step 4 — `build.extraResources` copies `src/backend/dist/CyrusServer.exe` into the installer. Always use the venv's own `pyinstaller` so it resolves `ccxt`.

### What ships

A self-contained installer: the Electron app, the compiled Flask backend, and all dependencies. End users need neither Python nor Node.

On first launch Electron starts the bundled backend, which creates its database at `%APPDATA%\Cyrus\kraking.db` and logs to `%APPDATA%\Cyrus\logs\cyrus.log`. Neither is removed by uninstalling or updating.

Closing the window minimises to the tray so automations keep running; quitting from the tray stops the backend too.

### Code signing

Unsigned builds trigger a "Windows protected your PC" SmartScreen warning on first install (users can click *More info → Run anyway*). A code signing certificate removes it.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Automations aren't running

Check the heartbeat pill at the top of the Automations page first — it tells you which of these you're in.

| Indicator | Meaning | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **Automations running** | Engine is healthy | Rules are being checked; see below |
| **Automations delayed** | Behind schedule | Usually exchange rate limiting; wait a cycle |
| **Automations STOPPED** / **NOT running** | Engine isn't checking anything | Restart Cyrus |
| **last check errored** | Cycling but failing | Hover for the error; check `logs\cyrus.log` |

If the engine is running but a specific rule never fires, open the **Log** tab — every skip is recorded with its reason. The most common causes:

- **Balance below threshold** — the rule is armed and waiting; nothing is wrong
- **Below the minimum withdrawal** — the trigger fired but the amount is under the exchange's minimum (Kraken's minimums, plus a 10% buffer, are in `ExchangeRegistry.py`). Raise the rule's threshold above that minimum
- **Cooldown active** — waiting out the interval since the last run
- **Rule auto-paused** — it hit its execution limit. Resuming won't help until you raise or clear the limit, or it will pause itself again

### Backend

**`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask'`** — activate the venv, then `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

**Port 5000 already in use** — the backend falls back to an OS-assigned port automatically and reports it via `CYRUS_PORT=`. If a previous `CyrusServer.exe` is still holding the port, packaged builds now clear it on launch; in dev, stop your other backend first.

**Nothing in the console after `CYRUS_PORT=`** — expected when launched by Electron. Output is redirected to `%APPDATA%\Cyrus\logs\cyrus.log` so a full stdout pipe can never block the worker. Running from a terminal keeps console output.

### Frontend

**`tsc is not recognized`** — use `npx tsc`, or `npm install -g typescript`.

**Blank screen** — open DevTools (View → Toggle Developer Tools) and check the console. Verify `dist/` is populated and any new script has a tag in `index.html`.

**"Not authenticated"** — clear localStorage and log in again.

### Database

Located at `%APPDATA%\Cyrus\kraking.db` when packaged, `src/backend/kraking.db` in dev. (Legacy filename — it is not `cyrus.db`.)

**Locked / permission errors** — make sure only one backend is running, and that antivirus isn't holding the file.

**Reset** — stop the backend, delete `kraking.db`, restart. A fresh database is created on boot. This deletes all accounts, connections, and rules.

## Security notes

- **Exchange API keys are Fernet-encrypted** (AES-128) at rest. The key is derived via SHA-256 from the Flask `SECRET_KEY`; keys are decrypted only when making an exchange call.
- **Passwords** are bcrypt-hashed. **JWTs** expire after 30 days.
- **All SQL is parameterised.**
- **The backend binds to `127.0.0.1` only** — it is never reachable from the network. Note that CORS is currently permissive (`origins: "*"`) for `/api/*`; every endpoint except `/api/health` still requires a valid token, and the renderer's CSP restricts it to `connect-src 'self' http://127.0.0.1:*`.
- **Electron runs with `contextIsolation: true` and `nodeIntegration: false`.** The renderer only receives what `preload.ts` exposes on `window.cyrus`. Add privileged capabilities via `ipcMain.handle` + a preload bridge method — never by enabling node integration.
- **Keep `.env` out of version control.**
